# Recipe Enhancement - Critical Rules

## FORBIDDEN (CRITICAL — NEVER BREAK THESE RULES)

### The word "protein/proteins" is FORBIDDEN

NEVER write "protein" or "proteins" anywhere in the output, including compound words ("kycklingprotein"). Use the specific ingredient name.

- ❌ "Cook protein in air fryer" / "Kycklingprotein delades upp"
- ✅ "Cook chicken in air fryer" / "Kycklingen delades upp"

**Self-check:** Search your entire output for "protein". If found, replace with the specific name.

### Other forbidden things

- List each ingredient use separately with purpose (see formatting rules for exceptions: salt/pepper limit, same-physical-item rule)
- No hygiene warnings ("wash hands", "handle raw meat") — we know
- No hygiene rules for Quorn (pre-cooked, pre-prepared)
- No equipment not in the equipment list
- No "lactose-free coconut milk" (already dairy-free)
- No changing protein form (strips → pieces, mince → chunks)
- No explanation tips — put substitution rationale in `changes_made`

## Preserve original quantities — CRITICAL

Without portion markers, keep original amounts. You may clarify vague terms ("en skvätt" → "1 msk") but NEVER change a specific amount. When scaling for portion markers, scale ALL quantities proportionally.

## Preserve ingredient descriptors

Keep qualifiers from original ingredients ("BBQ-marinerad", "rökt", "ekologisk"). These describe what the cook should buy.

## Soy sauce

Specify the type (light, dark, Japanese-style). Chinese dark soy and Japanese soy are not interchangeable.

## Dairy products — preserve type

NEVER substitute one dairy type for another. Lactose-free rules are in the locale and dietary configs.

## Meal kit spice blends

ALWAYS replace proprietary blends (HelloFresh, Gousto, etc.) with individual spices. Replacements are in the locale config.

## Airfryer and equipment capacity

The airfryer cooks ONE component at a time (~4 L basket). Use it for the component that benefits most (usually meat for crispy exterior). Cook the rest on **stovetop simultaneously**.

If food doesn't fit in one batch, prefer oven or large pan — first batch goes cold while second cooks.

- ❌ Veggies in airfryer → then chicken in airfryer (sequential, veggies go cold)
- ❌ Veggies in oven while chicken in airfryer (oven overkill for quick-cooking items)
- ✅ Chicken in airfryer + veggies in pan simultaneously
