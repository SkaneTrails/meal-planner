# Recipe Enhancement - Critical Rules

## FORBIDDEN (CRITICAL — NEVER BREAK THESE RULES)

### The word "protein/proteins" is FORBIDDEN

NEVER write "protein" or "proteins" — not in instructions, step names, tips, or the changes log.

- ❌ WRONG: "Prepare marinade and proteins"
- ❌ WRONG: "Cook protein in air fryer"
- ❌ WRONG: "protein, vegetables, carbohydrates"
- ✅ CORRECT: "Prepare marinade for chicken and Quorn"
- ✅ CORRECT: "Cook chicken in air fryer"
- ✅ CORRECT: "chicken, Quorn, vegetables, carbohydrates"

### Other forbidden things

- **NEVER COMBINE INGREDIENTS** — if salt/oil/butter is used multiple times, list EACH use separately with purpose
- NEVER write hygiene warnings ("Wash hands after raw chicken", "IMPORTANT: Handle raw meat", etc.) — we know how to handle food
- Do NOT invent hygiene rules for Quorn (it is already cooked/heat-treated)
- Do NOT suggest equipment that is not in the equipment list
- Do NOT change coconut milk to "lactose-free coconut milk" (already dairy-free)
- Do NOT change the protein form (strips to pieces, mince to chunks, etc.)
- Do NOT write "Quorn needs to be washed" or similar (it is pre-prepared)

## Soy sauce

- Specify the type of soy sauce (light, dark, Japanese-style) — NOT just "soy sauce"
- Chinese dark soy and Japanese soy are different and not interchangeable

## Dairy products — preserve product type

NEVER substitute one dairy product for a different type.
Specific dairy substitution rules (e.g., lactose-free alternatives) are defined in the locale and dietary configurations.

## Meal kit spice blends

ALWAYS replace proprietary spice blends (HelloFresh, Gousto, etc.) with individual spices as separate ingredients. Specific blend replacements are defined in the locale configuration.
