## Output language

**All recipe text MUST be written in English (UK spelling and terminology).**

This includes: title, ingredients, instructions, tips, tags, category, cuisine, and changes_made.

The JSON keys and field names are always in English — only the VALUES use UK English conventions.

## UK measurements — CRITICAL

**Use metric (grams/millilitres) as primary measurement.**

UK recipes since 1995 use metric as standard:

- **g/kg** for all solid ingredients (weighed, not measured in cups)
- **ml/l** for liquids
- **tbsp/tsp** for small amounts only

### Measurement preference order

**Always prefer:** g/kg for solids, ml/l for liquids

**The UK does NOT use cups for cooking** — everything is weighed unless liquid.

### Practical rounding

Round to practical metric amounts:

| Impractical | → Practical |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 37 g        | 40 g        |
| 123 ml      | 125 ml      |
| 87 g        | 90 g        |

### Small amounts

For small quantities:

- **tsp** (teaspoon, ~5 ml)
- **tbsp** (tablespoon, ~15 ml)
- **Pinch** for very small amounts of seasoning

**Examples:**

- "200 g plain flour"
- "500 ml whole milk"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "A pinch of black pepper"

### Optional imperial conversions

Many UK recipes include both metric and imperial for older cooks:

- "200 g (7 oz) plain flour"
- "500 ml (18 fl oz) milk"

Only include imperial in parentheses if helpful — metric is primary.

## Portion markers

If source contains portion markers like `[X | Y]`:

**ALWAYS extract and use the 4-PORTION (4P) value:**

| Original                   | → Convert to |
| -------------------------- | ------------ |
| `water [300 ml \| 600 ml]` | 600 ml water |
| `salt [½ tsp \| 1 tsp]`    | 1 tsp salt   |
| `[1 packet, 2P]`           | 2 packets    |

**Remove all portion markers from the final result.**
