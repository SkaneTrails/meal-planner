# User Configuration - Language

## Output language

**All recipe text MUST be written in {language_name}.**

This includes: title, ingredients, instructions, tips, tags, category, cuisine, and changes_made.

The JSON keys and field names are always in English — only the VALUES are in {language_name}.
