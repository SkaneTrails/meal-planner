# User Configuration — Dietary Preferences

## Household

- **People**: {people_count}
- **Servings per meal**: {target_servings}
<!-- BEGIN:meat_split -->
- **Setup**: {meat_eaters} of {target_servings} portions contain meat, {vegetarians} are vegetarian
- **Serving style**: Need to serve both meat and vegetarian at the same meal
  <!-- END:meat_split -->
  <!-- BEGIN:vegetarian -->
- **Setup**: Fully vegetarian household — no meat in any recipe
<!-- END:vegetarian -->

<!-- BEGIN:seafood_ok -->

## Fish and seafood

- Both eat fish and seafood
- No changes needed for fish/seafood recipes
- Keep seafood-derived condiments (oyster sauce, fish sauce, shrimp paste) as-is
  <!-- END:seafood_ok -->
  <!-- BEGIN:no_seafood -->

## Fish and seafood

- **No fish or seafood** — replace with vegetarian alternatives
- Also remove seafood-derived condiments (oyster sauce, fish sauce, shrimp paste)
<!-- END:no_seafood -->

<!-- BEGIN:meat_split -->

## Protein substitution

**When to split:** ONLY when the original recipe contains meat (chicken, beef, pork, lamb). The goal is to serve both a meat eater and a vegetarian at the same meal.

**When NOT to split:** If the original recipe is already vegetarian or vegan (tofu, tempeh, seitan, beans, lentils, eggs-only, etc.), keep it as-is. Do NOT add meat to a vegetarian recipe — both people eat it.

**How splitting works:** {target_servings} portions total — {meat_eaters} meat portions, {vegetarians} vegetarian portions. After scaling the recipe to {target_servings} servings, split the total protein proportionally — {meat_eaters}/{target_servings} of the protein is the meat variant, {vegetarians}/{target_servings} is the alternative.

- Example: 4 portions, 1 meat, 3 vegetarian. Original has 400 g chicken for 4P. Split → **100 g chicken (1/4) + 300 g chicken alternative (3/4)** ✅
- Counter-example: 400 g chicken + 400 g alternative ❌ (doubles the total protein)
- Counter-example: Original has 400 g tofu → keep 400 g tofu ✅ (do NOT add chicken ❌)

**Scaling must be practical:** Round quantities to sensible amounts. You cannot have ⅓ of an egg or 37 g of butter — round to whole eggs (or omit for one variant) and practical weights (25 g, 50 g, etc.).

### Chicken

- **Split**: {meat_eaters}/{target_servings} chicken + {vegetarians}/{target_servings} chicken alternative (proportional portions — see rule above)
- **Alternative**: Match the form — fillets, strips, or pieces
- **Important**: Match the protein form — "Sliced chicken breast" → alternative fillet strips
- **Flavor-match the alternative**: The vegetarian version should taste equally good, not like an afterthought. If the meat has a marinade, glaze, or spice rub, create a comparable seasoning for the alternative using pantry spices. The goal: both versions are satisfying on their own

### Other meat (beef, pork, lamb) — WHOLE CUTS ONLY

- **Split**: {meat_eaters}/{target_servings} original meat + {vegetarians}/{target_servings} meat alternative (NEVER use the chicken alternative for these meats)
- **Alternative**: Use the meat alternative in the appropriate form (chunks, pulled, kebab) depending on the dish
- **Applies to**: Steaks, roasts, strips, chunks, whole pieces — NOT mince
<!-- END:meat_split -->

<!-- BEGIN:vegetarian -->

## Protein substitution

**Replace ALL meat** with vegetarian alternatives. This is a fully vegetarian household.

- If the recipe is already vegetarian, keep it as-is — do NOT add meat
- See locale section for specific alternative products available in your region
<!-- END:vegetarian -->

<!-- BEGIN:soy_mince -->

### Mince / ground meat (all types) — CRITICAL, OVERRIDES SPLIT

**This rule takes priority over all other protein rules.**

ALL mince/ground meat is ALWAYS replaced with **100% soy mince** for everyone. No split, no other alternatives.

- **Rule**: 100% soy mince — NEVER split mince, NEVER use other alternatives for mince
- **Adjustment**: Less fat → add 1-2 tbsp oil when frying
- **Tip**: Add a splash of soy sauce or bouillon for umami
<!-- END:soy_mince -->

<!-- BEGIN:lactose_free -->

## Dairy

Use lactose-free alternatives for:

- Milk
- Cream
- Crème fraîche
- Cream cheese
- Kvarg

### EXCEPTIONS — do NOT change to lactose-free:

- **Butter** (very low lactose content)
- **Parmesan, Grana Padano, aged cheese** (naturally low lactose)
- **Ricotta, mozzarella**
- **Coconut milk, coconut cream** (already dairy-free!)
<!-- END:lactose_free -->

## Fats

**ALWAYS REVIEW** which oil/fat is used and whether it matches the cooking method.

### Butter

- **Butter → margarine** for regular frying where butter flavor doesn't matter
- **Keep butter** for: browned butter, butter sauces, herb butter, baking, finishing

### Oil

- **Olive oil → neutral oil/rapeseed oil** for high-heat cooking (searing, wok, frying pan)
- **Keep olive oil** for: dressings, finishing, Mediterranean dishes, low/medium heat

**Why:** Extra virgin olive oil has a low smoke point (~190°C) and is not suitable for high-heat frying. Rapeseed oil/neutral oil tolerates higher temperatures.
