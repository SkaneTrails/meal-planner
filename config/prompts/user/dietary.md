# User Configuration - Dietary Preferences

## Household

- **People**: {people_count}
- **Setup**: One eats meat, one is vegetarian
- **Serving style**: Often need to serve both meat and vegetarian at the same meal

## Fish and seafood

- Both eat fish and seafood
- No changes needed for fish/seafood recipes
- **Includes seafood-derived condiments**: ostronsås, fisksås, räkpasta — keep as-is

## Protein substitution

**When to split:** ONLY when the original recipe contains meat (chicken, beef, pork, lamb). The goal is to serve both a meat eater and a vegetarian at the same meal.

**When NOT to split:** If the original recipe is already vegetarian or vegan (tofu, tempeh, seitan, beans, lentils, Quorn, Oumph, eggs-only, etc.), keep it as-is. Do NOT add meat to a vegetarian recipe — both people eat it.

**How splitting works:** {people_count} people, {target_servings} servings — each person eats {servings_per_person} servings. One eats meat, one eats the vegetarian alternative. After scaling the recipe to the target servings, SPLIT the total protein in half — one half is the meat variant, the other half is the alternative.

- Example: Original has 300g chicken for 2P. Scaled to {target_servings}P = 600g total. Split → **300g chicken + 300g Quorn** ✅
- Counter-example: 600g chicken + 600g Quorn ❌ (this doubles the total protein — each person would get {target_servings} portions worth)
- Counter-example: Original has 400g tofu → keep 400g tofu ✅ (do NOT add 200g chicken ❌)

### Chicken

- **Split**: 50% chicken + 50% Quorn (full portions of each — see rule above)
- **Alternative**: Quorn fillets, strips, or pieces (match the form!)
- **Important**: Match the protein form — "Sliced chicken breast" → Quorn fillet strips
- **Quorn cooking**: Pan-fry with **smör (butter)** and rapsolja on high heat — Quorn is very lean and dries out in the airfryer. Best method: 1 msk smör + 1 msk rapsolja, quick high-heat sear. The butter adds flavor and richness that lean Quorn needs. If airfryer is absolutely necessary: brush with oil first, max 6-8 min at 180°C
- **Quorn is sold plain**: Quorn filéer/bitar are NOT pre-marinated. If the original meat is marinated (e.g. BBQ-marinerad kyckling), list the Quorn as plain and add a note in the instructions to season or briefly marinate it separately
- **Flavor-match the alternative**: The vegetarian version should taste equally good, not like an afterthought. If the meat has a marinade, glaze, or spice rub, create a comparable seasoning for the Quorn/Oumph using pantry spices. The goal: both versions are satisfying on their own

### Other meat (beef, pork, lamb) — WHOLE CUTS ONLY

- **Split**: 50% original meat + 50% Oumph! (NEVER Quorn for these meats)
- **Alternative**: Oumph! The Chunk, Pulled Oumph!, or Oumph! Kebab depending on the dish
- **Applies to**: Steaks, roasts, strips, chunks, whole pieces — NOT mince
- **Examples**:
  - 400g nötkött (ryggbiff) → 200g nötkött + 200g Oumph! The Chunk ✅ (NOT Quorn ❌)
  - 400g fläskkotlett → 200g fläskkotlett + 200g Oumph! The Chunk ✅
  - 400g lammkotlett → 200g lammkotlett + 200g Oumph! The Chunk ✅

### Mince / ground meat (all types) — CRITICAL, OVERRIDES SPLIT

**This rule takes priority over all other protein rules.**

ANY mince/ground meat — including blandfärs, nötfärs, fläskfärs, kycklingfärs, lammfärs — is ALWAYS replaced with **100% soy mince (sojafärs)** for everyone. No split, no Oumph.

- **Rule**: 100% sojafärs — NEVER split mince, NEVER use Oumph for mince
- **Adjustment**: Less fat → add 1-2 msk oil when frying
- **Tip**: Add a splash of soy sauce or bouillon for umami
- **Examples**:
  - 500 g blandfärs → 500 g sojafärs ✅ (NOT 250g blandfärs + 250g Oumph ❌)
  - 400 g nötfärs → 400 g sojafärs ✅
  - 300 g kycklingfärs → 300 g sojafärs ✅

## Dairy

Use lactose-free alternatives for:

- Milk
- Cream
- Crème fraîche
- Cream cheese
- Kesella/Kvarg

### EXCEPTIONS — do NOT change to lactose-free:

- **Butter** (very low lactose content)
- **Parmesan, Grana Padano, aged cheese** (naturally low lactose)
- **Ricotta, mozzarella**
- **Coconut milk, coconut cream** (already dairy-free!)

**Not exceptions** (DO mark as laktosfri): fetaost, färskost, grädde, mjölk, crème fraîche, kvarg, kesella.

## Fats

**ALWAYS REVIEW** which oil/fat is used and whether it matches the cooking method.

### Butter

- **Butter → margarine** for regular frying where butter flavor doesn't matter
- **Keep butter** for: browned butter, butter sauces, herb butter, baking, finishing

### Oil

- **Olive oil → neutral oil/rapeseed oil** for high-heat cooking (searing, wok, frying pan)
- **Keep olive oil** for: dressings, finishing, Mediterranean dishes, low/medium heat

**Why:** Extra virgin olive oil has a low smoke point (~190°C) and is not suitable for high-heat frying. Rapeseed oil/neutral oil tolerates higher temperatures.
