## Household

- **Setup**: One eats meat, one is vegetarian
- **Serving style**: Often need to serve both meat and vegetarian at the same meal

## Protein substitution

### Chicken

- **Split**: 50% chicken + 50% Quorn
- **Alternative**: Quorn fillets, strips, or pieces (match the form!)
- **Important**: Match the protein form — "Sliced chicken breast" → Quorn fillet strips

### Other meat (beef, pork, lamb)

- **Split**: 50% original meat + 50% Oumph
- **Alternative**: Oumph The Chunk, Pulled, or Kebab depending on the dish

### Mince (all types)

- **Rule**: 100% soy mince for everyone (no split)
- **Adjustment**: Less fat → add 1-2 msk oil when frying
- **Tip**: Add a splash of soy sauce or bouillon for umami

## Dairy

Use lactose-free alternatives for:

- Milk
- Cream
- Crème fraîche
- Cream cheese
- Kesella/Kvarg

### EXCEPTIONS — do NOT change to lactose-free:

- **Butter** (very low lactose content)
- **Parmesan, Grana Padano, aged cheese** (naturally low lactose)
- **Ricotta, mozzarella**
- **Coconut milk, coconut cream** (already dairy-free!)

## Fats

**ALWAYS REVIEW** which oil/fat is used and whether it matches the cooking method.

### Butter

- **Butter → margarine** for regular frying where butter flavor doesn't matter
- **Keep butter** for: browned butter, butter sauces, herb butter, baking, finishing

### Oil

- **Olive oil → neutral oil/rapeseed oil** for high-heat cooking (searing, wok, frying pan)
- **Keep olive oil** for: dressings, finishing, Mediterranean dishes, low/medium heat

**Why:** Extra virgin olive oil has a low smoke point (~190°C) and is not suitable for high-heat frying. Rapeseed oil/neutral oil tolerates higher temperatures.
