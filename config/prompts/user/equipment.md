## Available equipment

### Air fryer: Xiaomi Smart Air Fryer 4.5L

- **Capacity**: 2-3 chicken breasts or ~400g protein per batch
- **For 4 servings**: Plan for 2 batches (chicken first, rest while Quorn cooks)

**Good for air fryer:**

| Food                       | Temperature   | Time                |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Chicken breast/thigh (dry) | 180°C → 200°C | 10-12 min + 2-3 min |
| Breaded/panko-crusted fish | 180°C         | 8-10 min            |
| Halloumi, paneer           | 180°C         | 8-10 min            |
| Oumph (all variants)       | 200°C         | 8-10 min            |

**DO NOT use air fryer for:**

- **Quorn** (dries out → fry in butter on the stove instead)
- Protein that simmers in sauce (curry, stew, dal)
- Protein that is built into an oven dish

### Oven: IKEA FRILLESÅS

- **Convection**: Lower temp 20-25°C compared to recipe (175°C instead of 200°C)
- Use the oven for: vegetables, gratins, bakes
- NOT for individual proteins (use air fryer for that)

### Stove

- Standard, no limitations

## Equipment that does NOT exist

NEVER suggest these:

- Slow cooker
- Sous vide
- Instant pot
- Bread maker

## Cooking notes

### Quorn/Oumph cooking

- **Quorn is pre-cooked** — only needs to be heated and get a surface
- **Quorn is fried in butter on the stove** (2-3 min per side) — NOT air fryer (dries out)
- **Oumph works well in air fryer** (200°C 8-10 min) — already marinated, caramelizes nicely
- **Add Quorn/Oumph later** in oven dishes — they dry out if they're in the whole time
- **Separate batches** in air fryer due to capacity
- **Rest chicken** while vegetarian cooks (stays warm 5 min under foil)

### Vegetables — staggering for oven roasting

Different vegetables need different times. Do NOT put everything in at once!

| Vegetable          | Oven time at 175°C convection |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Potatoes (wedges)  | 25-30 min                     |
| Carrots (sticks)   | 20-25 min                     |
| Onion (wedges)     | 15-20 min                     |
| Broccoli (florets) | 12-15 min                     |
| Zucchini (slices)  | 10-15 min                     |

**Strategy for "everything on one tray":**

1. Potatoes + carrots in first (⏱️ 0 min)
2. Broccoli + onion in after 15 min (⏱️ 15 min)
3. Everything done at the same time (⏱️ 30 min)

### Butter topping for air fryer chicken

When chicken rests under foil after air fryer:

- Place a knob of butter and fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary) on the chicken
- The butter melts and adds extra juiciness
- Mention this as a 💡 tip in instructions
