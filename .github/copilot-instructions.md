# Meal Planner - AI Coding Agent Instructions

## Important: Collaboration Guidelines

You are collaborating with a human who may make changes between your edits:

- **Always re-verify** file contents before making changes - don't assume previous state
- **If your previous changes are gone**, do not re-add them without checking with the user first
- **Read before editing** - the human may have modified, moved, or intentionally removed content
- **Verify suggestions** - when given review comments or suggestions, verify they are correct against actual code before applying
- **Compare alternatives** - when the user suggests a different approach, analyze both options and explain the tradeoffs
- **Troubleshoot step-by-step** - when debugging, suggest one fix at a time and wait for results
- **Plan before large changes** - for complex changes (3+ files), propose a high-level plan first
- **Never work directly on main** - Always create a feature branch for changes

## Keeping Documentation Current

> **🚨 BLOCKING REQUIREMENT: Update docs BEFORE pushing.**
> Documentation updates are not optional. They are part of the definition of done.
> A PR with code changes but outdated docs is **incomplete and must not be merged**.

### Pre-Push Checklist (MANDATORY)

Before running `git push`, verify ALL applicable items:

- [ ] **Architecture changes** → Update `copilot-instructions.md` Architecture section
- [ ] **New/changed scripts** → Update `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` and `copilot-instructions.md`
- [ ] **New directories** → Update project structure in BOTH docs
- [ ] **New dependencies** → Document in `copilot-instructions.md` Key Dependencies
- [ ] **New API endpoints** → Update `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` API section
- [ ] **User-facing changes** → Update `README.md`
- [ ] **New skills** → Add to skills table in `copilot-instructions.md`

### Documentation Files

### Enforcement

**Before pushing, ask yourself:**

1. "Does the Architecture section reflect what actually exists?"
2. "Are all current directories documented in the project structure?"
3. "Can someone clone this repo and understand how to run everything?"

**If the answer is NO to any question, update the docs first.**

## Project Overview

**Meal Planner** is a recipe collector and weekly meal planner app built with Streamlit. It allows users to:

1. **Import recipes** from URLs - automatically extracts ingredients, instructions, and images
2. **Plan weekly meals** - organize recipes into a weekly calendar
3. **Generate grocery lists** - combine ingredients from planned meals

## Architecture

The project is a multi-platform meal planning system with three main interfaces:

| Platform | Directory | Stack | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Web (legacy) | `app/` | Streamlit | Original web UI |
| Mobile | `mobile/` | React Native + Expo | iOS/Android app |
| API | `api/` | FastAPI | REST backend for mobile |
| Functions | `functions/` | Google Cloud Functions | Serverless recipe scraping |

4. Grocery list generated by combining ingredients from planned recipes
5. (Optional) `recipe_enhancer.py` enhances recipes with Gemini AI

### Skills (AI Agent Instructions)

Skills in `.github/skills/` provide domain-specific instructions:

| Skill                 | Purpose                                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `recipe-improvement/` | Cooking techniques, equipment optimization, dietary preferences |
| `pr-review-workflow/` | PR creation, review comments, CI status, GitHub API patterns    |
| `working-context/`    | Track tasks and discovered issues across conversations          |

## Development Workflows

### Running the App

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
uv sync

# Run Streamlit web app (legacy)
uv run streamlit run app/main.py

# Run FastAPI backend
./scripts/run-api.sh
# Or manually:
uv run uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Run all dev services (API + mobile)
./scripts/run-dev.sh

# Run Cloud Function locally
./scripts/run-function.sh
```

### Running the Mobile App

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx expo start
```

### Mobile Web Deployment (Firebase Hosting)

The mobile app is deployed as a static web export to Firebase Hosting.

**Build command:** `npm run build:web` (runs font copy + `npx expo export --platform web`)

#### Known Pitfalls

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Fonts not bundled** | Expo static export doesn't include `@expo/vector-icons` fonts. Copy TTF to `public/fonts/` and load via `useFonts({ Ionicons: require('../public/fonts/Ionicons.ttf') })` |
| **NativeWind + Tailwind v4** | NativeWind 4 only supports Tailwind CSS v3. Renovate rule prevents v4 upgrades in `mobile/` |
| **OAuth redirect_uri_mismatch** | Add `https://<project>.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler` to BOTH OAuth clients in Google Cloud Console |
| **signInWithRedirect fails** | Cross-domain credential storage issue between localhost and firebaseapp.com. Use `signInWithPopup` instead |
| **CORS 403 Forbidden** | Cloud Run needs `allow_public_access = true` in Terraform for public API access |
| **COOP popup warning** | "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy would block window.close" is harmless - sign-in still works |

#### Authentication Flow (Web)

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" → `signInWithPopup(auth, googleProvider)`
2. Firebase handles OAuth flow via popup
3. On success, `onAuthStateChanged` fires with user
4. API requests include `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>`
5. FastAPI validates token via `firebase_admin.auth.verify_id_token()`

### Code Quality Tools

- **Package manager**: UV (Astral's fast Python package manager)
- **Linter/Formatter**: Ruff (configured in `pyproject.toml`)
  - Line length: 120 characters
  - Target: Python 3.14
- **Pre-commit hooks**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
  - Install: `uv run pre-commit install`
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage
  - Run: `uv run pytest --cov=app`
- **Conventional commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`

## Code Style

See `pyproject.toml` for tool configurations.

- **Ruff** for linting/formatting
- Test files must match `test_*.py` pattern
- **Self-documenting code**: Avoid inline comments - code should be readable without them
- **Test coverage**: All new methods and modified functions must have corresponding tests
- **Dataclasses**: Use dataclasses for models with `@dataclass` decorator
- **Type hints**: Use modern Python type hints (`list[str]` not `List[str]`)

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Strongly prefer TDD when implementing new features or modules.**

### When to Use TDD

- **New models** - Write tests first to define the data structure
- **New services** - Test edge cases before implementation
- **Bug fixes** - Write a failing test that reproduces the bug
- **Refactoring** - Ensure tests pass before and after

### Running Tests

```bash
uv run pytest -n=auto --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
uv run pytest tests/test_recipe.py -v
```

## Key Patterns & Conventions

### Recipe Scraping

- Uses `recipe-scrapers` library which supports 400+ recipe websites
- Always handle scraping errors gracefully - return `None` if scraping fails
- Extract: title, ingredients, instructions, image_url, servings, prep_time, cook_time

### Streamlit Patterns

- Use `st.session_state` for persisting data across reruns
- Use `st.spinner()` for long-running operations like HTTP requests
- Use `st.form()` for grouping inputs that should submit together
- Handle errors with `st.error()` and successes with `st.success()`

### Data Models

- Use Python dataclasses for all models
- Default mutable fields with `field(default_factory=list)`
- Add computed properties for derived values (e.g., `total_time_calculated`)

### Terraform Conventions

- **All infrastructure must be declared in Terraform** - no manual resource creation via console or CLI
- **Resource names** (buckets, databases, service accounts, etc.) must be defined in `terraform.tfvars` or `variables.tf`, never hardcoded in resource blocks
- **`gcloud` and `gsutil` commands** are only for troubleshooting, never for creating or modifying infrastructure
- Environment-specific values go in `infra/environments/{dev,prod}/terraform.tfvars`
- Shared module variables go in `infra/modules/*/variables.tf` with sensible defaults
- **Free tier compliance** - All resources must stay within GCP free tier limits

## When Making Changes

### Adding New Features

1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/feature-name`
2. Write tests first (TDD)
3. Implement the feature
4. Run tests and linting
5. Commit with conventional commit message
6. Push and create PR

### Adding Recipe Scraper Features

- Test with real recipe URLs from different sites
- Handle missing fields gracefully (not all sites have all info)
- Consider caching fetched recipes

### Adding Grocery List Features

- Implement ingredient parsing/normalization
- Group by category (produce, dairy, etc.)
- Handle quantity merging for duplicate items

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Persistent storage (JSON files or SQLite)
- [ ] Ingredient parsing and normalization
- [ ] Category detection for grocery items
- [ ] Recipe editing and manual entry
- [ ] Export grocery list to various formats
- [ ] User accounts and cloud sync

## Recipe Enhancement Architecture

The app includes AI-powered recipe enhancement using Gemini. The prompt system is designed for multi-tenant use.

> **Note:** The prompt structure below describes the planned architecture. Currently, the system prompt is embedded in `scripts/recipe_enhancer.py`. Separating prompts into external files is planned for future work.

### Design Principles

- **Public repo ready**: Anyone can clone, apply terraform, and run their own instance
- **Core vs User config**: Separate universal improvements from household-specific preferences
- **Additive equipment model**: Baseline is stove + oven; users list additional equipment they HAVE

### Prompt Structure

```
config/prompts/
  core/                    # Committed, English, applies to ALL users
    base.md                # Role, output JSON schema
    formatting.md          # Fractions (½ not 0.5), ingredient order, spices last
    timeline.md            # When/how to use ⏱️ timeline format
    hellofresh-spices.md   # Spice blend substitution tables

  user/
    example.yaml           # Committed - example household config
    household.yaml         # Gitignored - actual user config
```

### User Configuration Schema

```yaml
household:
  size: 2
  language: sv # Recipe output language

dietary:
  mode: flexitarian # omnivore | flexitarian | vegetarian | vegan
  lactose: lactose-free # normal | lactose-free | dairy-free
  gluten: normal
  allergies: []

  flexitarian:
    meat_split: 50 # % meat vs vegetarian
    minced_meat: vegetarian
    fish: keep

equipment:
  # Baseline assumed: stove, oven
  oven:
    has_convection: true
    temp_adjustment: -20
  additional:
    - airfryer:
        model: "Xiaomi Smart Air Fryer 4.5L"
        capacity_liters: 4.5

proteins:
  chicken_alternative: "Quorn"
  beef_alternative: "Oumph The Chunk"
  minced_alternative: "Sojafärs"
```

### Key Rules

- **Core prompts**: Always in English, no household-specific content
- **User config**: Can use any language for output, contains all personal preferences
- **Equipment**: Never suggest equipment not in user's config
- **Dietary modes**: Prompt logic adapts based on mode (e.g., flexitarian = split proteins)
